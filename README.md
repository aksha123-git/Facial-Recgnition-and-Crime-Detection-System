# Facial-Recgnition-and-Crime-Detection-System
Facial Recognition for Crime Detection is a project aimed at utilizing facial recognition technology to identify individuals involved in criminal activities. The system employs advanced algorithms to detect and recognize faces, comparing them with a database of known criminals or suspects. Key components of the project may include:

Face detection and recognition have become essential tools in criminal identification and investigation. Face detection involves identifying individuals by comparing their facial features to a database of known faces. In criminal identification, face detection and recognition are used to identify suspects and match them to surveillance footage or images from crime scenes. It has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and speed of criminal investigations and to increase public safety by enabling law enforcement to identify and apprehend dangerous criminals more quickly. However, the use of face detection and recognition technology also raises ethical and privacy concerns, as it can potentially be used to track individuals without their consent or to discriminate against certain groups. It is therefore important to use these tools responsibly and transparently and to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect individual rights and freedoms.

Face Detection: Using computer vision techniques to detect faces in images or video footage .
